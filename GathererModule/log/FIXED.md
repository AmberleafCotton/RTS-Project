# GathererModule Fixed Issues

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Issue 1: Acceptance Radius Too Large
**Issue**: Acceptance radius was currently 150 units, which was too large for precise slot positioning.
**Location**: `DepositMethod.cpp` and `GatherMethod.cpp` in `MoveToLocation()` functions
**Fix**: Reduced acceptance radius to 10 units for more precise positioning
**Priority**: Medium
**How it was fixed**: Changed `SetAcceptanceRadius(150.f)` to `SetAcceptanceRadius(10.f)` in both `UGatherMethod::MoveToLocation()` and `UDepositMethod::MoveToLocation()` functions.

### ✅ Issue 2: OnGatheringProgress Broadcast Timing
**Issue**: `OnGatheringProgress.Broadcast(0.0f, 0.0f)` was called in `ResourceGathered()` which was too late, especially with InstantDeposit's 0.2s delay.
**Location**: `GathererModule.cpp` line 103 and `NormalGathering.cpp` in `CompleteGathering()`
**Fix**: Moved progress reset to happen immediately when gathering completes, before any deposit logic starts
**Priority**: Medium
**How it was fixed**: Moved `OnGatheringProgress.Broadcast(0.0f, 0.0f)` from `ResourceGathered()` to `CompleteGathering()` in `NormalGathering.cpp`, so progress resets immediately when gathering finishes, regardless of deposit method timing.

### ✅ Issue 3: ResourceTarget Parameter in OnResourceGathered Event
**Issue**: `OnResourceGathered.Broadcast(TargetResource.Get(), ResourceAmount)` passes `TargetResource` which might be confusing.
**Location**: `GathererModule.cpp` line 102
**Fix**: Consider if we should pass the actual gathered resource or keep TargetResource for consistency
**Priority**: Low
**How it was fixed**: Marked as "KIND OF FIXED" - user determined this is acceptable as-is for now.

### ✅ Gameplay Tag Issue
**Issue**: `"PlayerResources"` tag was missing, causing deposit failures
**Fix**: Changed to `"Module.PlayerResources"` tag
**Status**: Resolved

### ✅ Initialization Order Issue
**Issue**: Owner wasn't set before initializing child methods
**Fix**: Proper initialization order in `GathererModule::InitializeModule_Implementation()`
**Status**: Resolved
